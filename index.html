                  <h3>By Alexandria Ng</h3>
                  <p align="left">Sweat drips down his chiseled jaw line as he flexes his muscles and lifts weights. He 

                  knows that after he finishes at the gym, he must go to the bar, discuss football with his 

                  bros, check out girls at the bar and eat his body weight’s worth in meat ­ all the while 

                  hiding his inner feelings rather than openly talk about them.</p>

                  <p align="left">The culture was created by black and Latino inner-city youth trying to express themselves artistically by speaking on discrimination and the harsh conditions that plagued the South Bronx in the 1970s, according to Ibram X. Kendi, a University of Florida professor, who will teach a history of hip-hop course in Spring 2016.</p>
                  <img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/masculinity/Male51.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-right" alt="HipHop Group">
                  <p align="left">This image of conventional manliness has pervaded society through a variety of platforms in modern American media.</p>

                  <p align="left">Whether advertisements show clean­cut men attracting the attention of all the ladies because of a certain “manly” cologne, or half­naked models showing off Calvin Klein boxer briefs, this notion of male masculinity centers around a Eurocentric ideal—that to be considered handsome, one must be buff and Caucasia.</p>

                  <p align="left">
                    Meanwhile, Asian American masculinity is often toned down and quasi­feminized in the

                    media. This, of course, ignores the growing minority’s ability to redefine what it means 

                    to be masculine, said University of Florida political science professor Samuel Stafford, 

                    who teaches a course on ethnic migration.
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                  “The femininity or background placement of minorities is to reduce the obviousperception of threat.”
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left">
                      Such threat, according to Stafford, reflects the idea that within the next few centuries, the complexion and culture of this country is going to change. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as “the browning of America.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">According to this theory, the rising population of different ethnic groups will eclipse the traditional “American Caucasian” person, and therefore challenge the status quo.</p>
                  <p align="left"><img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/masculinity/Male7.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">
                  <p align="left">However, this idea of preserving conventional white male masculinity is not one that has surfaced in recent studies, but rather, one that has been persisting for decades.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">Jeshow Yang, a University of Florida’s Queer Asians and Pacific Islanders organization 

                  facilitator and Asian Pacific Islander American Affairs ambassador, agrees with 

                  Stafford’s viewpoint, believing that it even started in the post­World War II era
                  .</p>
                 <p align="left">“After World War II, white males didn’t want Asian men to seem masculine and strong, 

so it would make white men look better,” Yang said. “That’s when Asian American men 

began to be seen as more effeminate and emasculated so they would seem weak. 

Femininity was attached to certain things like drinking tea, doing yoga or listening to 

classical music, so if you did any of these things, people would consider you feminine.”</p>

                      <p align="left">Finley’s passion led him to apply to UF 

                    after finding out there were multiple 

                    hip-hop dance groups on campus. He 

                    graduated with his bachelor’s in sociology and is currently getting his master’s in  management.</p>

                    <p align="left">“I don’t know what I would be doing

                    without hip-hop,” Finley said. “Probably 

                    living a more sheltered life -- not

                    developing myself more as an individual.”
                    </p>
                                    
                  <p align="left">
                      However, with the increase of diversity awareness, the issue of underrepresentation of minority groups in media has become an emerging topic of conversation.
                  </p>
                <p align="left">
                    “With what we grew up with, masculinity is idealized European features, like how 

                    handsomeness is based on extremely muscular Greek statues,” Yang said. “In media, 

                    Asian American men often fill those stereotypical background roles, especially in 

                    comedy.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    Mainstream American culture within the film industry tends to cast the lead male role as a tall, athletic­looking white man, Yang said. Seldom do Asian American men secure a part as the main character. Rather, they are frequently reduced to the socially awkward nerd who can’t get the girl or the friend whose only purpose is to provide comic relief.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    The stereotype that Asians have a greater mental prowess than bodily strength defy

                    society’s expectations of conventional masculinity ­  causing many Asian Americans to 

                    be overlooked when considering what defines “a real man” in the physical sense.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    Although traditional manliness focuses on the physical, masculinity is a frame of mind and comes from within, Stafford said. Although western culture equivocates masculinity with strength, it could also encompass confidence, interaction with one’s environment, as well as how one moves through space, Stafford said.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “Being a man means being committed to a long­term vision, being confident, being 

                    grounded in your values and have your actions align with your commitments,” University 

                    of Florida freshman Dylan Nong said. “To me, being a man is being vulnerable and not 

                    wearing a mask.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “Being a man means being committed to a long­term vision, being confident, being 
                    grounded in your values and have your actions align with your commitments,” University of Florida freshman Dylan Nong said. “To me, being a man is being vulnerable and not wearing a mask.”

                  <img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/masculinity/Male2.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">

                  <p align="left">
                    This mask refers to the feeling of needing to put up a front to be seen by others as a true man. Whereas the societal stereotype may include talking about sports, picking up women at local bars and building tool sheds from scratch, the less­mentioned facet of masculinity includes being mature in one’s development as a human being, Nong said.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “In a sense, masculinity is being mature, wise and open­minded,” said University of 

                    Florida senior Ravik Samaroo, a member of the multicultural fraternity Sigma Beta Rho. 

                    “Everyone is slightly different when it comes to working out, but not everything can get 

                    that big; everybody has their own potential with their body, so when it comes to the 

                    physical aspect, you can’t discriminate. That’s why I stress intelligence.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    The ongoing generalization that Asian American men are usually shorter, smaller and

                    weaker than men of other ethnicities contributes to a possible lack of self­esteem in 

                    Asian boys who grow up in America and feel that they do not measure up when 

                    compared to their Caucasian peers, said University of Florida freshman Victor Lin.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “I’ve always been a really skinny person and sometimes I didn’t feel that confident,” Lin said. “We live in America, which is predominantly white, and they have roots in European culture, so the media here is still tied to that. We [Asians] are different, but we have our own culture where our standards of handsome men are different.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">Just as beauty for women is defined differently around the world, beauty standards for men also vary.</p>
                  <p align="left">
                    According to BuzzFeed News, Asian countries such as South Korea and India 

                    encourage soft facial features, makeup wearing and skin lightening among men. The 

                    emphasis on male cosmetics has made the Asia Pacific region the largest consumer of 

                    men’s skincare products, male cosmetic surgery hot spot and men’s fashion.
                  </p>
                <p align="left">
                  However, the Asian male tendency to dress themselves in fashion­forward clothing as  an emerging trend of metrosexuality can be seen as femininity in America.
                </p>

                <p align="left">
                  Another persisting stereotype against Asian American men and the measure of their 

masculinity has to do with the size of their genitalia. Although there is little scientific 

evidence to prove this theory, this idea continues to be circulated throughout popular 

culture.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “It goes back to controlling to minimize fear,” Stafford said. “It is a way by the majority western culture to downgrade or minimize the perceived threat or fear of a seemingly intellectually superior identifiable group, especially males.”
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                 Despite similarities in what is considered handsome and manly in other countries, such  as a lean, muscular body, American media rarely portrays Asian men as sexual beings or the image of masculinity. The stereotype that Asians are purely academic persists even into the 21st century, Samaroo said.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “[Asian Americans] shouldn’t be offended; every culture, every ethnicity has their own 

stereotypes, whether it’s true or not,” Samaroo said. “There will always be stereotypes, 

and that will never change, but as long as people don’t let it affect them, then I don’t 

really have a problem with it.”
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  As more Asian Americans come into the spotlight, they prove that Asian men are well-
rounded and cannot be generalized as merely skinny and submissive males as often 

portrayed in the media. Actors such as Ken Jeong, Aziz Ansari and Randall Park 

pioneer the way for more exposure to Asian American males in American culture and 

redefine the conventions of the physicality of masculinity.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “We need change in the future because this society is robbed of the benefits that can be offered if men don’t put forth, or aren’t able to put forth, and invest all that they have in a particular country, culture or location,” Stafford said. “You’re going to have half the power for discovery and for productivity.”

                          “It’s of a woman that’s wearing a niqab that’s completely black, which is very uniform and not 

representative of the diversity and heterogeneity of Muslim women,” she said, referring to the 

veil that entirely covers the woman’s face, popular in some predominantly Arab countries such 

as Oman, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

                        <p align="left">
                          Seeing a lack in media representation for Muslim women and the prevalent misconceptions of 

women who wear hijabs, Abdelhamid created the Facebook page ‘Hijabis of New York” to 

highlight the stories of hijabis, in a style similar to the popular Facebook page, “Humans of New 

York”.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Movement</h2>
                        <p align="left">Abdelhamid started “Hijabis of New York” to humanize Muslim women, who are particularly susceptible to hate crime.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “There is research that shows that 80 percent of hate crimes that happen against Muslims, happen against Muslim women,” Abdelhamid said. “Hijabi women are a subset of Muslim women who may be more vulnerable to attack because of the visibility of their faith identity.”

                            While Abdelhamid acknowledges that this project cannot completely solve the problem, she 

hopes to make a difference. Through “Hijabis of New York”, she has learned about the diversity 

of experience among Muslim women, and found that some of the violence hijabis experience  

comes from within the community. In her trips to Spain and the U.K., Abdelhamid found similar 

narratives.

                          “I went into this thinking that this would be a platform to raise awareness for other people, for 

non­Muslims, and for men and non­veiled people who maybe might better understand the 

experiences of veiled women,” Abdelhamid said. “But what ended up happening was a lot of the 

engagement that we had was from Muslim veiled women themselves.”

hijab.”

                          Rashid starting wearing the hijab after her parents got divorced, a major change in her life. 

Many of her relatives did not approve of her wearing the hijab, out of fear that she would be 

subject to Islamophobia and discrimination. She first made the decision to wear the hijab in 

middle school, but stopped after about a month due to physical bullying.

                        <p align="left">
                          She started permanently wearing the hijab on the first day of 10th grade. Learning how to keep 

the hijab in place and finding a style that was flattering for her face was a struggle because 

Rashid did not have many people to ask how to wear it.

                        <p align="left">
                          But for Malaysian American Wan Ainal Yaqin, 36, learning to wear a hijab was not as difficult.

                        <p align="left">
                          Yaquin started wearing the hijab at 13 years old. By that time she was used to wearing hijab for

prayer and had seen many women put it on, which she said made it easier for her.

                          For Sleiman, wearing a hijab is a careful balance between displaying one’s faith and maintaining 

its sanctity.

                        <p align="left">
                          Sleiman said she is offended by those who appropriate the hijab, because the hijab is a 

religious and political symbol and wearing it as a non Muslim devalues it.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “Completely divorcing it of its religious meaning would be an injustice,” Sleiman said.

entire life.

“The fact that I’m wearing hijab doesn’t mean that I’m just an open book for you to learn from,” 

she said.

                          “How could I refuse my dying father?” asked Lane Wilcken softly.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          After Wilcken’s father, Willis Lane Wilcken, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, doctors 

suggested marking his skin so they could track the radiation that would soon be used to fight the aggressive disease.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">Wilcken’s father didn’t want a stranger marking his skin, so Wilcken found a stick, shaped a hole inside and plucked a thorn from his mother’s lemon tree.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          While his brother stretched their father’s skin, Wilcken used Indian ink and the Filipino

tattoo method of tapping to paint his first tattoo on his dad.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                            At the time Wilcken had no intention of becoming a tattoo practitioner and the tattoo he 

drew was not a traditional one either, but by tattooing his father,  Wilcken carried on a Filipino 

tradition.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Method and History</h2>
                        <p align="left">
                          As a Nevada­based tattoo practitioner and writer of the book “Filipino Tattoos Ancient to 

Modern,” Wilcken has spent 25 years studying this tradition of “batok,” the name of the 

traditional Filipino tattooing method.  According to Wilcken, the practice is deeply ritualistic.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          After a client researches his ancestry, the tattoo practitioner helps them choose a design 

and placement of the tattoo in accordance with the client’s religious practices.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                            Then, he follows the detailed, traditional process: There is a food sacrifice where blood 

is drained to ward off evil spirits and Wilcken speaks ancient prayers. But before the food 

sacrifice is put away, the client is asked to speak something from their heart, and the food 

offering is burnt or buried.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                            The actual design is done by a tapping method, in which a piece of lemon thorns or 

boar tusks are carved to fit into the end of a stick. A hammer is lightly tapped against the stick to

                        <h2>The Lost Culture</h2>
                        <p align="left"><img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/tatoo/Tattoo2.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum"></p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Because of society’s association between crime and tattoos and coupled  with the

tendency for Filipinos to migrate to other countries for work and education, the traditional art of 

Filipino tattooing is endangered according to Wilcken.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “The tendency of those who migrated away is to assimilate into the predominant culture 

of wherever they are living,” he said. “So we lose language, and we lose the practices, which 

usually happens with the first generation.”
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          According to Wilcken, this lost culture is what drives his passion for spreading cultural

awareness through his tattoo work. He contends that the common thread that pulls modern­day 

Filipino Americans to get traditional tattoos is a search for identity and belonging.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>“The tattoo isn't about you, most of the tattoos are about being part of something bigger than yourself,” Wilcken said.</blockquote>
                        <h2>The People</h2>
                        <p align="left">
                          Felicia Perez, a psychology teacher at Diablo Valley College in California, embarked on

a journey into her Filipino roots after her father’s death. She said always felt that her ancestors 

wanted her to take on a tattoo, but  an email from Wilcken was the push she needed to finally 

do it.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          For Perez, her tattoos are visual reminders of that connection.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                         "Tattoos ground me,” Perez said. “When I look in the mirror, I'm like, ‘Yes, this is who I 

am.’ It's a reminder I'm from an indigenous culture that has a lot of gifts to give to the world.”
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          According to Wilcken, by receiving a tattoo, an individual is establishing an open 

relationship with their ancestors for protection and wisdom. The artist said that this feeling is 

similar to one of instinctively taking another route home and later finding out the original route 

was clogged with traffic.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “Those designs represent the ancestor spirit and their communication with the person,” Wilcken said.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Perez also said that her tattoos not only link her to to her ancestors, but mark who she is 

as a person and the obstacles she’s overcome.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>"It's like sharing the same space in time,” Perez said. "Things are changing all the time and reconfiguring itself, but it also still feels anchored in the past."</blockquote>

                        <p align="left">
                            For other recipients, the Filipino history of earning tattoos is more important.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                         Lauren Funiestas, a 32­year­old health coach, waited five years after meeting Wilcken to get a tattoo.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          She waited until she finished her graduate studies and started her career so her tattoos 

could represent something she earned. Funiestas said that her tattoos decision was an act of 

following her ancestor’s footsteps.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Funiestas, who has 11 tattoos, said that her the traditional ones were less painful but the

process was imbued with a lot of emotional meaning.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “There was more care”, Funiestas said. “Lane sat down and talked to me and explained 

every line, what it meant and why it was there. It meant a lot to me that my ancestors were 

coming in this tattoo. I felt like I was being honored and not like a cattle coming in a tattoo shop 

and coming out.”
                        </p>
                        <h2>Past and Future</h2>
                        <p align="left">
                          At 21 years old, Jasmine Mendoza, a student at San Francisco State University, received her first Filipino tattoo. The communications studies student understands both the media and the younger generation's role in making traditional tattooing more known to Filipino Americans.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Filipino Americans should do their research. The biggest challenge is educating Filipino 

Americans about their own culture, according to Mendoza.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “I feel like having this media attention is the first step but it also stems deeper than that 

especially for this generation, especially for us raised in America when we don't even hear 

about our history let alone our history in America, so it's an education thing,” Mendoza said.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          At its core Batok focuses on family, a cultural value that remains relevant to this day. 

Wilcken emphasizes that respecting the ancestors who are alive are equally important as 

respecting those who have passed.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>“It’s the pinnacle of our past culture,” Wilcken said.</blockquote>
                        <p align="left">
                          “Many know Filipinos for their hospitality, basing a strong support system in their family. 

Traditional tattoos seem to bring those full circle.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          The title of Mababatok, or tattoo practitioner, is usually given by a village,  but Wilcken 

has been able find a community where he has made his mark. Now, clients like Lauren 

Funiestas, Felicia Perez and Jasmine Mendoza refer to him with the same title as those before 

him: Mababatok. Like the tattoos that were given to Filipinos in centuries past, Lane Wilcken is 

immortalizing and honoring his ancestors through his work and giving that gift to others.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                         “The designs themselves are repetitive for a reason,” Wilcken said,  “It shows the

continuity of the family line. We are just part of a link in a chain of ancestors and descendants 

going back through time and forward in time, that we're part of a whole."
                        </p>

                        “I think the Asian American community,
                        by supporting Black Lives Matter and
                        supporting other initiatives of people of
                        color, are also making a statement,” Padilla
                        said. “They’re saying, in many words, that
                        ‘in spite of how you label us, we are not
                        willing to remain outside the efforts of overcoming inequality.’”

                        The Asian American community
                        continues to lend strong support to
                        the efforts of the Black Lives Matter
                        movement through rallies as well as
                        creating its own means of support through
                        the hashtag, #Asians4BlackLives, which
                        emerged after the deaths of Michael
                        Brown and Eric Garner.

                        biomedical science freshman, said of the
                        social media campaign. “This certainly has
                        shown how long of a way a simple hashtag
                        can influence an entire movement.”
