                  <p align="left">Sweat drips down his chiseled jaw line as he flexes his muscles and lifts weights. He 

                  knows that after he finishes at the gym, he must go to the bar, discuss football with his 

                  bros, check out girls at the bar and eat his body weight’s worth in meat ­ all the while 

                  hiding his inner feelings rather than openly talk about them.</p>

                  <p align="left">The culture was created by black and Latino inner-city youth trying to express themselves artistically by speaking on discrimination and the harsh conditions that plagued the South Bronx in the 1970s, according to Ibram X. Kendi, a University of Florida professor, who will teach a history of hip-hop course in Spring 2016.</p>
                  <img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/masculinity/Male51.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-right" alt="HipHop Group">
                  <p align="left">This image of conventional manliness has pervaded society through a variety of platforms in modern American media.</p>

                  <p align="left">Whether advertisements show clean­cut men attracting the attention of all the ladies because of a certain “manly” cologne, or half­naked models showing off Calvin Klein boxer briefs, this notion of male masculinity centers around a Eurocentric ideal—that to be considered handsome, one must be buff and Caucasia.</p>

                  <p align="left">
                    Meanwhile, Asian American masculinity is often toned down and quasi­feminized in the

                    media. This, of course, ignores the growing minority’s ability to redefine what it means 

                    to be masculine, said University of Florida political science professor Samuel Stafford, 

                    who teaches a course on ethnic migration.
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                  “The femininity or background placement of minorities is to reduce the obviousperception of threat.”
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="left">
                      Such threat, according to Stafford, reflects the idea that within the next few centuries, the complexion and culture of this country is going to change. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as “the browning of America.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">According to this theory, the rising population of different ethnic groups will eclipse the traditional “American Caucasian” person, and therefore challenge the status quo.</p>
                  <p align="left"><img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/masculinity/Male7.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">
                  <p align="left">However, this idea of preserving conventional white male masculinity is not one that has surfaced in recent studies, but rather, one that has been persisting for decades.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">Jeshow Yang, a University of Florida’s Queer Asians and Pacific Islanders organization 

                  facilitator and Asian Pacific Islander American Affairs ambassador, agrees with 

                  Stafford’s viewpoint, believing that it even started in the post­World War II era
                  .</p>
                 <p align="left">“After World War II, white males didn’t want Asian men to seem masculine and strong, 

so it would make white men look better,” Yang said. “That’s when Asian American men 

began to be seen as more effeminate and emasculated so they would seem weak. 

Femininity was attached to certain things like drinking tea, doing yoga or listening to 

classical music, so if you did any of these things, people would consider you feminine.”</p>

                      <p align="left">Finley’s passion led him to apply to UF 

                    after finding out there were multiple 

                    hip-hop dance groups on campus. He 

                    graduated with his bachelor’s in sociology and is currently getting his master’s in  management.</p>

                    <p align="left">“I don’t know what I would be doing

                    without hip-hop,” Finley said. “Probably 

                    living a more sheltered life -- not

                    developing myself more as an individual.”
                    </p>
                                    
                  <p align="left">
                      However, with the increase of diversity awareness, the issue of underrepresentation of minority groups in media has become an emerging topic of conversation.
                  </p>
                <p align="left">
                    “With what we grew up with, masculinity is idealized European features, like how 

                    handsomeness is based on extremely muscular Greek statues,” Yang said. “In media, 

                    Asian American men often fill those stereotypical background roles, especially in 

                    comedy.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    Mainstream American culture within the film industry tends to cast the lead male role as a tall, athletic­looking white man, Yang said. Seldom do Asian American men secure a part as the main character. Rather, they are frequently reduced to the socially awkward nerd who can’t get the girl or the friend whose only purpose is to provide comic relief.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    The stereotype that Asians have a greater mental prowess than bodily strength defy

                    society’s expectations of conventional masculinity ­  causing many Asian Americans to 

                    be overlooked when considering what defines “a real man” in the physical sense.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    Although traditional manliness focuses on the physical, masculinity is a frame of mind and comes from within, Stafford said. Although western culture equivocates masculinity with strength, it could also encompass confidence, interaction with one’s environment, as well as how one moves through space, Stafford said.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “Being a man means being committed to a long­term vision, being confident, being 

                    grounded in your values and have your actions align with your commitments,” University 

                    of Florida freshman Dylan Nong said. “To me, being a man is being vulnerable and not 

                    wearing a mask.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “Being a man means being committed to a long­term vision, being confident, being 
                    grounded in your values and have your actions align with your commitments,” University of Florida freshman Dylan Nong said. “To me, being a man is being vulnerable and not wearing a mask.”

                  <img data-img-src="assets/images/issue10/masculinity/Male2.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">

                  <p align="left">
                    This mask refers to the feeling of needing to put up a front to be seen by others as a true man. Whereas the societal stereotype may include talking about sports, picking up women at local bars and building tool sheds from scratch, the less­mentioned facet of masculinity includes being mature in one’s development as a human being, Nong said.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “In a sense, masculinity is being mature, wise and open­minded,” said University of 

                    Florida senior Ravik Samaroo, a member of the multicultural fraternity Sigma Beta Rho. 

                    “Everyone is slightly different when it comes to working out, but not everything can get 

                    that big; everybody has their own potential with their body, so when it comes to the 

                    physical aspect, you can’t discriminate. That’s why I stress intelligence.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    The ongoing generalization that Asian American men are usually shorter, smaller and

                    weaker than men of other ethnicities contributes to a possible lack of self­esteem in 

                    Asian boys who grow up in America and feel that they do not measure up when 

                    compared to their Caucasian peers, said University of Florida freshman Victor Lin.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “I’ve always been a really skinny person and sometimes I didn’t feel that confident,” Lin said. “We live in America, which is predominantly white, and they have roots in European culture, so the media here is still tied to that. We [Asians] are different, but we have our own culture where our standards of handsome men are different.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">Just as beauty for women is defined differently around the world, beauty standards for men also vary.</p>
                  <p align="left">
                    According to BuzzFeed News, Asian countries such as South Korea and India 

                    encourage soft facial features, makeup wearing and skin lightening among men. The 

                    emphasis on male cosmetics has made the Asia Pacific region the largest consumer of 

                    men’s skincare products, male cosmetic surgery hot spot and men’s fashion.
                  </p>
                <p align="left">
                  However, the Asian male tendency to dress themselves in fashion­forward clothing as  an emerging trend of metrosexuality can be seen as femininity in America.
                </p>

                <p align="left">
                  Another persisting stereotype against Asian American men and the measure of their 

masculinity has to do with the size of their genitalia. Although there is little scientific 

evidence to prove this theory, this idea continues to be circulated throughout popular 

culture.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “It goes back to controlling to minimize fear,” Stafford said. “It is a way by the majority western culture to downgrade or minimize the perceived threat or fear of a seemingly intellectually superior identifiable group, especially males.”
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                 Despite similarities in what is considered handsome and manly in other countries, such  as a lean, muscular body, American media rarely portrays Asian men as sexual beings or the image of masculinity. The stereotype that Asians are purely academic persists even into the 21st century, Samaroo said.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “[Asian Americans] shouldn’t be offended; every culture, every ethnicity has their own 

stereotypes, whether it’s true or not,” Samaroo said. “There will always be stereotypes, 

and that will never change, but as long as people don’t let it affect them, then I don’t 

really have a problem with it.”
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  As more Asian Americans come into the spotlight, they prove that Asian men are well-
rounded and cannot be generalized as merely skinny and submissive males as often 

portrayed in the media. Actors such as Ken Jeong, Aziz Ansari and Randall Park 

pioneer the way for more exposure to Asian American males in American culture and 

redefine the conventions of the physicality of masculinity.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “We need change in the future because this society is robbed of the benefits that can be offered if men don’t put forth, or aren’t able to put forth, and invest all that they have in a particular country, culture or location,” Stafford said. “You’re going to have half the power for discovery and for productivity.”

                          “It’s of a woman that’s wearing a niqab that’s completely black, which is very uniform and not 

representative of the diversity and heterogeneity of Muslim women,” she said, referring to the 

veil that entirely covers the woman’s face, popular in some predominantly Arab countries such 

as Oman, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Seeing a lack in media representation for Muslim women and the prevalent misconceptions of 

women who wear hijabs, Abdelhamid created the Facebook page ‘Hijabis of New York” to 

highlight the stories of hijabis, in a style similar to the popular Facebook page, “Humans of New 

York”.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Movement</h2>
                        <p align="left">Abdelhamid started “Hijabis of New York” to humanize Muslim women, who are particularly susceptible to hate crime.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “There is research that shows that 80 percent of hate crimes that happen against Muslims, happen against Muslim women,” Abdelhamid said. “Hijabi women are a subset of Muslim women who may be more vulnerable to attack because of the visibility of their faith identity.”

                            While Abdelhamid acknowledges that this project cannot completely solve the problem, she 

hopes to make a difference. Through “Hijabis of New York”, she has learned about the diversity 

of experience among Muslim women, and found that some of the violence hijabis experience  

comes from within the community. In her trips to Spain and the U.K., Abdelhamid found similar 

narratives.

                          “I went into this thinking that this would be a platform to raise awareness for other people, for 

non­Muslims, and for men and non­veiled people who maybe might better understand the 

experiences of veiled women,” Abdelhamid said. “But what ended up happening was a lot of the 

engagement that we had was from Muslim veiled women themselves.”

hijab.”

                          Rashid starting wearing the hijab after her parents got divorced, a major change in her life. 

Many of her relatives did not approve of her wearing the hijab, out of fear that she would be 

subject to Islamophobia and discrimination. She first made the decision to wear the hijab in 

middle school, but stopped after about a month due to physical bullying.

                        <p align="left">
                          She started permanently wearing the hijab on the first day of 10th grade. Learning how to keep 

the hijab in place and finding a style that was flattering for her face was a struggle because 

Rashid did not have many people to ask how to wear it.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          But for Malaysian American Wan Ainal Yaqin, 36, learning to wear a hijab was not as difficult.

                        <p align="left">
                          Yaquin started wearing the hijab at 13 years old. By that time she was used to wearing hijab for

prayer and had seen many women put it on, which she said made it easier for her.

                          For Sleiman, wearing a hijab is a careful balance between displaying one’s faith and maintaining 

its sanctity.

                        <p align="left">
                          Sleiman said she is offended by those who appropriate the hijab, because the hijab is a 

religious and political symbol and wearing it as a non Muslim devalues it.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “Completely divorcing it of its religious meaning would be an injustice,” Sleiman said.

entire life.

“The fact that I’m wearing hijab doesn’t mean that I’m just an open book for you to learn from,” 

she said.

                        supporting other initiatives of people of
                        color, are also making a statement,” Padilla
                        said. “They’re saying, in many words, that
                        ‘in spite of how you label us, we are not
                        willing to remain outside the efforts of overcoming inequality.’”

                        The Asian American community
                        continues to lend strong support to
                        the efforts of the Black Lives Matter
                        movement through rallies as well as
                        creating its own means of support through
                        the hashtag, #Asians4BlackLives, which
                        emerged after the deaths of Michael
                        Brown and Eric Garner.

                        biomedical science freshman, said of the
                        social media campaign. “This certainly has
                        shown how long of a way a simple hashtag
                        can influence an entire movement.”
